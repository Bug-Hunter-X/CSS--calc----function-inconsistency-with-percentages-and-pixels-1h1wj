To solve the issue, avoid directly subtracting pixels from percentages within the `calc()` function. A more reliable approach is to calculate the percentage-based widths and then handle the pixel adjustments separately using margins or padding.  Here's a corrected version:

```css
.sidebar {
  width: 20%;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

.main {
  width: 80%;
  margin-left: 22%; /* 20% + 10px/2 (half of the extra space) */
}
```

This revised CSS ensures that the sidebar and main content areas consistently add up to the full viewport width, resolving the layout discrepancies caused by the original `calc()` implementation.
