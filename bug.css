The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error: unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with percentages and viewport units.  The intention is to create a sidebar that takes up 20% of the viewport width, and a main content area that occupies the remaining 80%. However, the calculation might not produce the expected result in certain browsers or situations.

```css
.sidebar {
  width: calc(20% - 10px);
  float: left;
}

.main {
  width: calc(80% + 10px);
  margin-left: 20%;
}
```
